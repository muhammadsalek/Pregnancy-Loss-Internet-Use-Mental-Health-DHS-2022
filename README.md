Study Overview
Mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, are prevalent among ever-married women in Bangladesh. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has jointly examined the associations between pregnancy loss, internet use, and mental health outcomes using nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022. This repository contains all R scripts, Stata files, tables, and figures used to reproduce the analyses reported in the published article.

Key Findings

Among 19,987 ever-married women, 5.13% experienced moderate to severe depression and 4.48% experienced moderate to severe anxiety.

Pregnancy loss was associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety:

One loss: Depression AOR = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.18–1.41), Anxiety AOR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.20–1.43)

Two or more losses: Depression AOR = 1.43 (95% CI: 1.24–1.68), Anxiety AOR = 1.82 (95% CI: 1.55–2.14)

Internet use in the past 12 months was associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.59–0.71) and depression (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69–0.85)

Regional disparities: Rangpur division has the highest burden of mental health symptoms, while Dhaka has the lowest.

Conclusion: Pregnancy loss increases the risk of depression and anxiety, while internet use reduces it. Enhancing reproductive health programs and internet access in high-burden areas is necessary.
